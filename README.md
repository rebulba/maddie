* An Art Portfolio Application

* Ruby on Rails backend
- JSON API uses jbuilder to format response

* Backbone.js front end
- models Projects, nested photo collection, and media

* Consider...
- Set up a mailer and people can enter their email address
- Make media pictures change by a timer.
- Seed Media and standard tags
- Ensure pictures of different sizes format the same (must be a gem to do this)
- Duplicate for rebecca, but ensure code can be deployed to both places for updates
- Needs Contact info page (maybe a form to email)
- Links to purchase

- figure out scripts to deploy on paid hosting

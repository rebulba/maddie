* An Art Portfolio Application

* Ruby on Rails backend
- JSON API uses jbuilder to format response

* Backbone.js front end
- models Projects, nested photo collection, and media

* Consider...
- Set up a mailer and people can enter their email address
- Make media pictures change by a timer.
- Seed Media and standard tags
- Ensure pictures of different sizes format the same (must be a gem to do this)
- Duplicate for rebecca, but ensure code can be deployed to both places for updates
- Needs Contact info page (maybe a form to email)
- Links to purchase

- User should be able to add tags to projects (Dropdown list of tags to add.. or radio button)
- elegent way to handle scrolling. load first pictures of a project (high def) in order going down.

- Hover over a medium. have medium appear as h1 tag on page

- Rather than change picture sizes on index page (dont set img height, width) but have the css styling arrange to bufffer the space (ensure square).

- Add cv section
- (maybe add a thing to add sections)
- make different section texts loadable..
- each project photo has its own info page... (rebecca has many photos per project that are projects of their own)

-rebecca has most recent version of app... update at madelinecann.com

-cropping all versions of photo (maybe save different versions. but have one marked as cropped)
- make main project photo not the first of its photos (one must set it creating a new project... then use the cropping screen)

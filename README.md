A web app for uploading and displaying custom content.

Models

* User
   - Can register multiple domains with custom content for each one.
   - This allows this app to sit on one machine but serve content specific to
     a domain or subdomain

* Pages
   - By default the root url shows all pages tied to a user
   - A user can edit the page content. Markdown allows pictures to be inserted
     into the body of the page.

* Projects
   - Projects allow photos to be uploaded. A project can have a description,
     title, cover photo, and multiple other photos.
   - The UI for displaying projects is a work in progress. This might be removed
     for simplicity

* Meta properties
    - Each domain can change the root page content. For example, if someone has
      a birthday, I could honor them with a quick custom message stored in the
      `root_content` column of the meta_property_list. That way the message is
      available at `adriancann.com` rather than a page
      `adriancann.com/happy-birthday`
    - The more serious reason is that some people may not want the rootmenu as
      is.

Current Hosting:

* This project is deployed to a digital ocean droplet running Ubuntu, Phusion
  Passenger and NGINX.
